This is a Flask application that serves a simple webpage with an image.

To run the application, first install Flask. Then, clone this repository and run the following command:

```
python app.py
```

The application will be served on port 5000. You can access it by visiting http://localhost:5000 in your browser.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. The first line imports the Flask library.
2. The second line creates a Flask application object.
3. The third line defines a route for the "/" path. This route will return a simple HTML page with an image.
4. The fourth line defines the style for the HTML page.
5. The fifth line is the main function of the application. This function is called when the application is started. It gets the port number from the environment variable "PORT" and starts the application on that port.

I hope this helps!
